# ECMA-335: Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)

This repository holds a manually prepared Markdown transcription of the Ecma International standard [ECMA-335: Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), 6th edition (June 2012)](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm). (I am making use of the permission granted in the documents' copyright notice to create derivative works which translate the standards document to other formats.)

I have started this transcription because the standard contains a ton of cross references, which makes working with the document in PDF or book form quite painful&mdash;especially since the original PDF document is not properly indexed for fast TOC navigation.

The transcription is currently far from complete. Collaborations and contributions are welcome! If you would like to help, please make sure you have read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), which among other things include the formatting conventions used for the transcription.
