## I.6.2.3 Summary

The CTS is about integration between languages: using another language's objects as if they were one's own.

CTS是关于语言之间的整合：使用另一种语言的对象，就好像它们是自己的一样。



The objective of the CLI is to make it easier to write components and applications in any language. It does this by defining a standard set of types, by making all components fully selfdescribing, and by providing a high performance common execution environment. This ensures that all CLI-compliant system services and components will be accessible to all CLI-aware languages and tools. In addition, this simplifies deployment of components and applications that use them, all in a way that allows compilers and other tools to leverage the high performance execution environment. The CTS covers, at a high level, the concepts and interactions that make all of this possible.

CLI的目标是使用任何语言编写组件和应用程序变得更容易。它通过定义一组标准类型、使所有组件完全自描述以及提供高性能公共执行环境来实现这一点。这确保了所有兼容cli的系统服务和组件都可以被所有支持cli的语言和工具访问。此外，这简化了组件和使用它们的应用程序的部署，所有这些都允许编译器和其他工具利用高性能执行环境。CTS在高层次上涵盖了使这一切成为可能的概念和相互作用。



The discussion is broken down into four areas:

讨论分为四个方面：



 * Type System &ndash; What types are and how to define them.
 * 什么是类型以及如何定义它们。



 * Metadata &ndash; How types are described and how those descriptions are stored.
 * 元数据如何描述类型以及如何存储这些描述。



 * Common Language Specification &ndash; Restrictions required for language interoperability.
 * 语言互操作性所需的限制。



 * Virtual Execution System &ndash; How code is executed and how types are instantiated, interact, and die.
 * 代码如何执行，类型如何实例化、交互和消亡。
