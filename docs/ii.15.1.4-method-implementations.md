## II.15.1.4 Method implementations

A _MethodImpl_, or method implementation, supplies the executable body for an existing virtual method. It associates a _Method_ (representing the body) with a _MethodDecl_ or _Method_ (representing the virtual method). A _MethodImpl_ is used to provide an implementation for an inherited virtual method or a virtual method from an interface when the default mechanism (matching by name and signature) would not provide the correct result. See ยง[II.22.27](ii.22.27-methodimpl-0x19.md).
