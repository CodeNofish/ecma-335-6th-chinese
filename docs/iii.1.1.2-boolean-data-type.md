## III.1.1.2 Boolean data type

A CLI Boolean type occupies 1 byte in memory. A bit pattern of all zeroes denotes a value of false. A bit pattern with any one or more bits set (analogous to a non-zero integer) denotes a value of true. For the purpose of stack operations boolean values are treated as unsigned 1-byte integers (ยง[III.1.1.1](#todo-missing-hyperlink)).
