## I.7.2 Views of CLS compliance

> _This block contains only informative text._

The CLS is a set of rules that apply to generated assemblies. Because the CLS is designed to support interoperability for libraries and the high-level programming languages used to write them, it is often useful to think of the CLS rules from the perspective of the high-level source code and tools, such as compilers, that are used in the process of generating assemblies. For this reason, informative notes are added to the description of CLS rules to assist the reader in understanding the rule's implications for several different classes of tools and users. The different viewpoints used in the description are called **framework**, **consumer**, and **extender**, and are described here.
