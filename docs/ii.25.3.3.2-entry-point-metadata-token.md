## II.25.3.3.2 Entry point metadata token

 * The entry point token (ยง[II.15.4.1.2](ii.15.4.1.2-the-entrypoint-directive.md)) is always a _MethodDef_ token (ยง[II.22.26](ii.22.26-methoddef-0x06.md)) or _File_ token (ยง[II.22.19](ii.22.19-file-0x26.md)) when the entry point for a multi-module assembly is not in the manifest assembly. The signature and implementation flags in metadata for the method indicate how the entry is run.
