## I.4.2 Informative text

This International Standard is intended to be used by implementers, academics, and application programmers. As such, it contains explanatory material that, strictly speaking, is not necessary in a formal specification.

Examples are provided to illustrate possible forms of the constructions described. References are used to refer to related clauses or subclauses. Notes are provided to give advice or guidance to implementers or programmers. Annexes provide additional information.

Except for whole clauses or subclauses that are identified as being informative, informative text that is contained within normative clauses and subclauses is identified as follows:

 * The beginning and end of a block of informative text is marked using rectangular boxes.

 * As some informative passages span pages, informative text also contains a bold set of vertical black stripes in the right margin.

 * By the use of the following pairs of markers: _[Example:_ &hellip; _end example]_, _[Note:_ &hellip; _end note]_, and _[Rationale:_ &hellip; _end rationale]_. Unless text is identified as being informative, it is normative.
