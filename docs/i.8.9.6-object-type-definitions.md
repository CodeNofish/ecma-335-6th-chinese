## I.8.9.6 Object type definitions

All objects are instances of an **object type**. The object type of an object is set when the object is created and it is immutable. The object type describes the physical structure of the instance and the operations that are allowed on it. All instances of the same object type have the same structure and the same allowable operations. Object types are explicitly declared by a class type definition, with the exception of array types, which are intrinsically provided by the VES.
