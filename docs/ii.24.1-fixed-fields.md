## II.24.1 Fixed fields

Complete CLI components (metadata and CIL instructions) are stored in a subset of the current Portable Executable (PE) File Format (ยง[II.25](#todo-missing-hyperlink)). Because of this heritage, some of the fields in the physical representation of metadata have fixed values. When writing these fields it is best that they be set to the value indicated, on reading they should be ignored.
