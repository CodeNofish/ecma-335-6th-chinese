## VI.Annex A Introduction

[VI.Annex A](vi.a-introduction.md) this annex.

[VI.Annex B](vi.b-sample-programs.md) contains a number of sample programs written in CIL Assembly Language (ILAsm)

[VI.Annex C](vi.c-cil-assembler-implementation.md) contains information about a particular implementation of an assembler, which provides a superset of the functionality of the syntax described in [Partition II](#todo-missing-hyperlink). It also provides a machine-readable description of the CIL instruction set which can be used to derive parts of the grammar used by this assembler as well as other tools that manipulate CIL.

[VI.Annex D](vi.d-class-library-design-guidelines.md) contains a set of guidelines used in the design of the libraries of [Partition IV](#todo-missing-hyperlink). The rules are provided here since they have proven themselves effective in designing cross-language APIs. They also serve as guidelines for those intending to supply additional functionality in a way that meshes seamlessly with the standardized libraries.

[VI.Annex E](vi.e-portability-considerations.md) contains information of interest to implementers with respect to the latitude they have in implementing the CLI.

[VI.Annex F](vi.f-imprecise-faults.md) contains information of interest to implementers with respect to relaxed fault handling.

[VI.Annex G](vi.g-parallel-library.md) shows several complete examples written using the parallel library.
