## I.8.5 Naming

Names are given to entities of the type system so that they can be referred to by other parts of the type system or by the implementations of the types. Types, fields, methods, properties, and events have names. With respect to the type system, values, locals, and parameters do not have names. An entity of the type system is given a single name (e.g., there is only one name for a type).
