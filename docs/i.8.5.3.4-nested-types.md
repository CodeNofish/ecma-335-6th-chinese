## I.8.5.3.4 Nested types

A type can be a member of an enclosing type, in which case, it is a nested type. A nested type has the same visibility as the enclosing type and has an accessibility as would any other member of the enclosing type. This accessibility determines which other types can make references to the nested type. That is, for a class to define a field or array element of a nested type, have a method that takes a nested type as a parameter or returns one as value, etc., the nested type shall be both visible and accessible to the referencing type. A nested type is part of the enclosing type so its methods have access to all members of its enclosing type, as well as family access to members of the type from which it inherits (see ยง[I.8.9.8](#todo-missing-hyperlink)). The names of nested types are scoped by their enclosing type, not their assembly (only top-level types are scoped by their assembly). There is no requirement that the names of nested types be unique within an assembly.
