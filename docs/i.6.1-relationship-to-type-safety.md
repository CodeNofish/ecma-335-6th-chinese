## I.6.1 Relationship to type safety

Type safety is usually discussed in terms of what it does (e.g., guaranteeing encapsulation between different objects) or in terms of what it prevents (e.g., memory corruption by writing where one shouldn't). However, from the point of view of the CTS, type safety guarantees that:

 * **References are what they say they are** &ndash; Every reference is typed, the object or value referenced also has a type, and these types are assignment compatible (see ยง[I.8.7](#todo-missing-hyperlink)).

 * **Identities are who they say they are** &ndash; There is no way to corrupt or spoof an object, and, by implication, a user or security domain. Access to an object is through accessible functions and fields. An object can still be designed in such a way that security is compromised. However, a local analysis of the class, its methods, and the things it uses, as opposed to a global analysis of all uses of a class, is sufficient to assess the vulnerabilities.

 * **Only appropriate operations can be invoked** &ndash; The reference type defines the accessible functions and fields. This includes limiting visibility based on where the reference is (e.g., protected fields only visible in derived classes).

The CTS promotes type safety (e.g., everything is typed). Type safety can optionally be enforced. The hard problem is determining if an implementation conforms to a type-safe declaration. Since the declarations are carried along as metadata with the compiled form of the program, a compiler from the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) to native code (see ยง[I.8.8](#todo-missing-hyperlink)) can type-check the implementations.
