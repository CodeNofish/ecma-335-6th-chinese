## IV.4 Kernel Profile feature requirements

All conforming implementations of the CLI support at least the Kernel Profile. Consequently, all CLI features required by the Kernel Profile shall be implemented by all conforming implementations. This clause defines that minimal feature set, by enumerating the set of features that are not required; i.e., a minimal conforming implementation shall implement all CLI features except those specified in the remainder of this clause. The feature requirements of individual Libraries as specified in ยง[IV.5](#todo-missing-hyperlink) are defined by reference to restricted items described in this clause. For ease of reference, each feature has a name indicated by the name of the clause or subclause heading. Where Libraries do not specify any additional feature requirement, it shall be assumed that only the features of the Kernel Profile as described in this clause are required.
