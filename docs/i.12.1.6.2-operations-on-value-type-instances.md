## I.12.1.6.2 Operations on value type instances

Value type instances can be [created](#todo-missing-hyperlink), [passed](#todo-missing-hyperlink) as arguments, [returned](#todo-missing-hyperlink) as values, and stored into and extracted from locals, fields, and elements of arrays (i.e., [copied](#todo-missing-hyperlink)). Like classes, value types can have both static and non-static members (methods and fields). But, because they carry no type information at runtime, value type instances are not substitutable for items of type `System.Object`; in this respect, they act like the built-in types `int32`, `int64`, and so forth. There are two operations, [`box`](#todo-missing-hyperlink) and [`unbox`](#todo-missing-hyperlink), that convert between value type instances and objects.
