## II.15.1.2 Method definitions

A _Method_, or method definition, supplies the method name, attributes, signature, and body. That is, a method definition provides a _MethodHeader_ as well as one or more _MethodBodyItems_. The body includes the method's CIL instructions, exception handlers, local variable information, and additional runtime or custom metadata about the method. See ยง[II.22.26](ii.22.26-methoddef-0x06.md).
