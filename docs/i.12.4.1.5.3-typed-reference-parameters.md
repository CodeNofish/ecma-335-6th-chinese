## I.12.4.1.5.3 Typed reference parameters

By-reference parameters and value types are sufficient to support statically typed languages (C++, Pascal, etc.). They also support dynamically typed languages that pay a performance penalty to box value types before passing them to polymorphic methods (Lisp, Scheme, Smalltalk, etc.). Unfortunately, they are not sufficient to support languages like Visual Basic that require byref passing of unboxed data to methods that are not statically restricted as to the type of data they accept. These languages require a way of passing *both* the address of the home of the data *and* the static type of the home. This is exactly the information that would be provided if the data were boxed, but without the heap allocation required of a box operation.

Typed reference parameters address this requirement. A typed reference parameter is very similar to a standard byref parameter but the static data type is passed as well as the address of the data. Like byref parameters, the argument corresponding to a typed reference parameter will have a home.

_[Note:_ If it were not for the fact that verification and the memory manager need to be aware of the data type and the corresponding address, a byref parameter could be implemented as a standard value type with two fields: the address of the data and the type of the data. _end note]_

Like a regular byref parameter, a typed reference parameter can refer to a home that is on the stack, and that home will have a lifetime limited by the call stack. Thus, the CIL generator shall apply appropriate checks on the lifetime of byref parameters; and verification imposes the same restrictions on the use of typed reference parameters as it does on byref parameters (see ยง[I.12.4.1.5.2](#todo-missing-hyperlink)).

A typed reference is passed by either creating a new typed reference (using the `mkrefany` instruction) or by copying an existing typed reference. Given a typed reference argument, the address to which it refers can be extracted using the `refanyval` instruction; the type to which it refers can be extracted using the `refanytype` instruction.
