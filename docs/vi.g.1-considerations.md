## VI.G.1 Considerations

The programmer is responsible for ensuring that the loop iterations are *independent* (for sake of correctness) and have sufficient *grain size* (for sake of efficiency.)  Loop iterations are *independent* if they can be carried out in arbitrary order, or concurrently and still produce the right answer. The *grain size* is the amount of work performed by a loop iteration. If the grain size is too small, the overhead (calling the delegate, synchronizing with other threads, etc.) may overwhelm the intended work. The ideal is to make the grain size large and uniform, but not so large as to make it difficult to distribute work evenly across physical threads. For efficiency, `ParallelFor` is the preferred loop class when there is a choice. It tends to be the most efficient because it has the least general iteration space.
