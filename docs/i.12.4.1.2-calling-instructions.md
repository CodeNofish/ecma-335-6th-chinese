## I.12.4.1.2 Calling instructions

The CIL has three call instructions that are used to transfer argument values to a destination method. Under normal circumstances, the called method will terminate and return control to the calling method.

 * `call` is designed to be used when the destination address is fixed at the time the CIL is linked.  In this case, a method reference is placed directly in the instruction. This is comparable to a direct call to a static function in C. It can be used to call static or instance methods or the (statically known) base class method within an instance method body.

 * `calli` is designed for use when the destination address is calculated at run time. A method pointer is passed on the stack and the instruction contains only the call site description.

 * `callvirt`, part of the CIL common type system instruction set, uses the class of an object (known only at runtime) to determine the method to be called. The instruction includes a method reference, but the particular method isnâ€™t computed until the call actually occurs.  This allows an instance of a derived class to be supplied and the method appropriate for that derived class to be invoked.  The `callvirt` instruction is used both for instance methods and methods on interfaces. For further details, see the CTS specification and the CIL instruction set specification in [Partition III](#todo-missing-hyperlink).

In addition, each of these instructions can be immediately preceded by a `tail.` instruction prefix. This specifies that the calling method terminates with this method call (and returns whatever value is returned by the called method). The `tail.` prefix instructs the JIT compiler to discard the caller's method state prior to making the call (if the call is from untrusted code to trusted code the frame cannot be fully discarded for security reasons). When the called method executes a `ret` instruction, control returns not to the calling method but rather to wherever that method would itself have returned (typically, return to caller's caller). Notice that the `tail.` instruction shortens the lifetime of the caller's frame so it is unsafe to pass managed pointers (type `&`) as arguments.

Finally, there are two instructions that indicate an optimization of the `tail.` case:

 * `jmp` is followed by a **methodref** or **methoddef** token and indicates that the current method's state should be discarded, its arguments should be transferred intact to the destination method, and control should be transferred to the destination. The signature of the calling method shall exactly match the signature of the destination method.
