## I.8.9.8 Type inheritance

Inheritance of types is another way of saying that the derived type guarantees support for all of the type contracts of the base type. In addition, the derived type usually provides additional functionality or specialized behavior. A type inherits from a base type by implementing the type contract of the base type. An interface type implements zero or more other interfaces. Value types do not inherit, although the associated boxed type is an object type and hence inherits from other types.

The derived class type shall support all of the supported interfaces contracts, class contracts, event contracts, method contracts, and property contracts of its base type. In addition, all of the locations defined by the base type are also defined in the derived type. The inheritance rules guarantee that code that was compiled to work with a value of a base type will still work when passed a value of the derived type. Because of this, a derived type also inherits the implementations of the base type. The derived type can extend, override, and/or hide these implementations.
