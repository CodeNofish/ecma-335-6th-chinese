## I.8.9.6.2 Concreteness

An object type can be marked as **abstract** by the object type definition. An object type that is not marked **abstract** is, by definition, **concrete**. Only object types can be declared as abstract. Only an abstract object type is allowed to define method contracts for which the type or the VES does not also provide the implementation. Such method contracts are called **abstract methods** (see ยง[I.8.11](i.8.11-member-definitions.md)). Methods on an abstract class need not be abstract.

It is an error to attempt to create an instance of an abstract object type, whether or not the type has abstract methods. An object type that derives from an abstract object type can be concrete if it provides implementations for all abstract methods in the base object type and is not itself marked as abstract. Instances can be made of such a concrete derived class. Locations can have an abstract type, and instances of a concrete type that derives from the abstract type can be stored in them.
