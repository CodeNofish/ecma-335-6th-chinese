## II.22.27 MethodImpl: 0x19

_MethodImpl_ tables let a compiler override the default inheritance rules provided by the CLI. Their original use was to allow a class `C`, that inherited method `M` from both interfaces `I` and `J`, to provide implementations for both methods (rather than have only one slot for `M` in its vtable). However, _MethodImpls_ can be used for other reasons too, limited only by the compiler writer's ingenuity within the constraints defined in the Validation rules below.

In the example above, _Class_ specifies `C`, _MethodDeclaration_ specifies `I::M`, _MethodBody_ specifies the method which provides the implementation for `I::M` (either a method body within `C`, or a method body implemented by a base class of `C`).

The _MethodImpl_ table has the following columns: 

 * _Class_ (an index into the _TypeDef_ table)

 * _MethodBody_ (an index into the _MethodDef_ or _MemberRef_ table; more precisely, a _MethodDefOrRef_ (ยง[II.24.2.6](ii.24.2.6-metadata-stream.md)) coded index)

 * _MethodDeclaration_ (an index into the _MethodDef_ or _MemberRef_ table; more precisely, a _MethodDefOrRef_ (ยง[II.24.2.6](ii.24.2.6-metadata-stream.md)) coded index)

ILAsm uses the **.override** directive to specify the rows of the _MethodImpl_ table (ยง[II.10.3.2](ii.10.3.2-the-override-directive.md) and ยง[II.15.4.1](ii.15.4.1-method-body.md)).

 5. The owner Type of the method indexed by _MethodDeclaration_ shall not have _Flags_.`Sealed` = 0 \[ERROR\]

 6. The method indexed by _MethodBody_ shall be a member of _Class_ or some base class of _Class_ (*MethodImpl*s do not allow compilers to 'hook' arbitrary method bodies) \[ERROR\]
