## I.12.1.6.2.5 Boxing and unboxing

**Boxing** and **unboxing** are conceptually equivalent to (and can be seen in higher-level languages as) casting between a value type instance and `System.Object`. Because they change data representations, however, boxing and unboxing are like the widening and narrowing of various sizes of integers (the `conv` and `conv.ovf` instructions) rather than the casting of reference types (the `isinst` and `castclass` instructions). The `box` instruction is a widening (always type-safe) operation that converts a value type instance to `System.Object` by making a copy of the instance and embedding it in a newly allocated object. `unbox` is a narrowing (runtime exception can be generated) operation that converts a `System.Object` (whose exact type is a value type) to a value type instance. This is done by computing the address of the embedded value type instance without making a copy of the instance.
