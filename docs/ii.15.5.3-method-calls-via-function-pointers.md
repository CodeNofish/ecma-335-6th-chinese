## II.15.5.3 Method calls via function pointers

Unmanaged methods can also be called via function pointers. There is no difference between calling managed or unmanaged methods with pointers. However, the unmanaged method needs to be declared with **pinvokeimpl** as described in ยง[II.15.5.2](ii.15.5.2-platform-invoke.md). Calling managed methods with function pointers is described in ยง[II.14.5](ii.14.5-method-pointers.md).
