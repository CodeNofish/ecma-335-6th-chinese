## I.8.11.5 Nested type definitions

A nested type definition is identical to a top-level type definition, with one exception: a top-level type has a visibility attribute, while the visibility of a nested type is the same as the visibility of the enclosing type. See ยง[I.8.5.3](i.8.5.3-visibility-accessibility-and-security.md).
