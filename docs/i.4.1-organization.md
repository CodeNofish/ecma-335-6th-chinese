## I.4.1 Organization

The divisions of this International Standard are organized using a hierarchy. At the top level is the *Partition*. The next level is the *clause*, followed by *subclause*. Divisions within a subclause are also referred to as subclauses. Partitions are numbered using Roman numerals. All other divisions are numbered using Arabic digits with their place in the hierarchy indicated by nested numbers. For example, Partition II, 14.4.3.2 refers to subclause 2 in subclause 3 in subclause 4 in clause 14 in Partition II.
