## VI.Annex C CIL assembler implementation

> _This clause contains only informative text._

This clause provides information about a particular assembler for CIL, called _ilasm_. It supports a superset of the syntax defined normatively in [Partition II](#todo-missing-hyperlink), and provides a concrete syntax for the CIL instructions specified in [Partition III](#todo-missing-hyperlink).

Even for those who have no interest in this particular assembler, ยง[VI.C.1](#todo-missing-hyperlink) and ยง[VI.C.3](#todo-missing-hyperlink) might be of interest. The former is a machine-readable file (ready for input to a C or C++ preprocessor) that partially describes the CIL instructions. It can be used to generate tables for use by a wide variety of tools that deal with CIL. The latter contains a concrete syntax for CIL instructions, which is not described elsewhere.
