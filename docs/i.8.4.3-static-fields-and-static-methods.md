## I.8.4.3 Static fields and static methods

Types can declare locations that are associated with the type rather than any particular value of the type. Such locations are **static fields** of the type. As such, static fields declare a location that is shared by all values of the type. Just like non-static (instance) fields, a static field is typed and that type never changes. Static fields are always restricted to a single application domain basis (see ยง[I.12.5](i.12.5-proxies-and-remoting.md)), but they can also be allocated on a per-thread basis.

Similarly, types can also declare methods that are associated with the type rather than with values of the type. Such methods are **static methods** of the type. Since an invocation of a static method does not have an associated value on which the static method operates, there is no **this** pointer available within a static method.
