## I.7.1 Introduction

The CLS is a set of rules intended to promote language interoperability. These rules shall be followed in order to conform to the CLS. They are described in greater detail in subsequent clauses and are summarized in ยง[I.11](i.11-collected-common-language-specification-rules.md). CLS conformance is a characteristic of types that are generated for execution on a CLI implementation. Such types must conform to the CLI standard, in addition to the CLS rules. These additional rules apply only to types that are visible in assemblies other than those in which they are defined, and to the members that are accessible outside the assembly; that is, those that have an accessibility of **public**, **family** (but not on sealed types), or **family-or-assembly** (but not on sealed types).

_[Note:_ A library consisting of CLS-compliant code is herein referred to as a *framework*. Compilers that generate code for the CLI can be designed to make use of such libraries, but not to be able to produce or extend such library code. These compilers are referred to as *consumers*. Compilers that are designed to both produce and extend frameworks are referred to as *extenders*. In the description of each CLS rule, additional informative text is provided to assist the reader in understanding the rule's implication for each of these situations. _end note]_
