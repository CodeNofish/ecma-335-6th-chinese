## I.8.3.1 Assignment-compatible locations

A value can be stored in a location only if one of the types of the value is **assignment compatible** with the type of the location. A type is always *assignable-to* itself. Assignment compatibility can often be determined at compile time, in which case, there is no need for testing at run time. Assignment compatibility is described in detail in ยง[I.8.7](#todo-missing-hyperlink).
