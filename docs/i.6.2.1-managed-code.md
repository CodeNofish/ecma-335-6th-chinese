## I.6.2.1 Managed code

**Managed code** is code that provides enough information to allow the CLI to provide a set of core services, including

 * Given an address inside the code for a method, locate the metadata describing the method

 * Walk the stack

 * Handle exceptions

 * Store and retrieve security information
 
 This standard specifies a particular instruction set, the CIL (see [Partition III](#todo-missing-hyperlink)), and a file format (see [Partition II](#todo-missing-hyperlink)) for storing and transmitting managed code.
