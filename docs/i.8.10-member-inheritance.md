## I.8.10 Member inheritance

Only object types can inherit implementations, hence only object types can inherit members (see ยง[I.8.9.8](i.8.9.8-type-inheritance.md)). While interface types can be derived from other interface types, they only "inherit" the requirement to implement method contracts, never fields or method implementations.
