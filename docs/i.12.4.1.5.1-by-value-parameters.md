## I.12.4.1.5.1 By-value parameters

For built-in types (integers, floats, etc.) the caller copies the value onto the stack before the call. For objects the object reference (type `O`) is pushed on the stack. For managed pointers (type `&`) or unmanaged pointers (type `native unsigned int`), the address is passed from the caller to the callee. For value types, see the protocol in ยง[I.12.1.6.2](i.12.1.6.2-operations-on-value-type-instances.md).
