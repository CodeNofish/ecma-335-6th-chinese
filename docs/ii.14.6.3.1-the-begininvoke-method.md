## II.14.6.3.1 The BeginInvoke method

An asynchronous call to a delegate shall begin by making a virtual call to the `BeginInvoke` method. `BeginInvoke` is similar to the `Invoke` method (ยง[II.14.6.1](ii.14.6.1-delegate-signature-compatibility.md)), but has two differences:

 * It has two additional parameters, appended to the list, of type `System.AsyncCallback`, and `System.Object`.

 * The return type of the method is `System.IAsyncResult`.

Although the `BeginInvoke` method therefore includes parameters that represent return values, these values are not updated by this method. The results instead are obtained from the `EndInvoke` method (see below). Unlike a synchronous call, an asynchronous call shall provide a way for the caller to determine when the call has been completed. The CLI provides two such mechanisms. The first is through the result returned from the call. This object, an instance of the interface `System.IAsyncResult`, can be used to wait for the result to be computed, it can be queried for the current status of the method call, and it contains the `System.Object` value that was passed to the call to `BeginInvoke`. See [Partition IV](#todo-missing-hyperlink).

The second mechanism is through the `System.AsyncCallback` delegate passed to `BeginInvoke`. The VES shall call this delegate when the value is computed or an exception has been raised indicating that the result will not be available. The value passed to this callback is the same value passed to the call to `BeginInvoke`. A value of null can be passed for `System.AsyncCallback` to indicate that the VES need not provide the callback.

_[Rationale:_ This model supports both a polling approach (by checking the status of the returned `System.IAsyncResult`) and an event-driven approach (by supplying a `System.AsyncCallback`) to asynchronous calls. _end rationale]_

A synchronous call returns information both through its return value and through output parameters. Output parameters are represented in the CLI as parameters with managed pointer type. Both the returned value and the values of the output parameters are not available until the VES signals that the asynchronous call has completed successfully. They are retrieved by calling the `EndInvoke` method on the delegate that began the asynchronous call.
