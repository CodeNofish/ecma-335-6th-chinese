 | Attribute | Description
 | ---- | ----
 | `AttributeUsageAttribute` | Used to specify how an attribute is intended to be used.
 | `ObsoleteAttribute` | Indicates that an element is not to be used.
 | `CLSCompliantAttribute` | Indicates whether or not an element is declared to be CLS compliant through an instance field on the attribute object.
